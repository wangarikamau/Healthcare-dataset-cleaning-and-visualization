# Healthcare-dataset-cleaning-and-visualization


This project explores patterns in a healthcare dataset to understand how factors like income, insurance, and checkups relate to patient demographics.

##  Objectives

- Clean and prepare raw healthcare data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends using Python (Matplotlib & Seaborn)
- Derive real-world insights useful for healthcare policy or planning

##  Data Cleaning Summary

- Filled missing categorical values with "Unknown"
- Replaced empty numeric fields with median or 0
- Ensured uniform data types

## Key Questions Explored

- Do patients with children have better insurance coverage?
- How does income affect checkup and screening behavior?
- What is the age distribution of insured vs uninsured individuals?

##  Visualizations

- **Bar chart:** Insurance status by number of children
- **Stacked bar:** Age range vs insurance
- **Pie chart:** Test preparation completion
- **Histogram:** Income distribution by insurance

##  Key Insights

- Patients with insurance are **2Ã— more likely** to attend regular checkups.
- **Average income is ~30% higher** for patients who completed cancer screening.
- People with **more children** tend to have **higher insurance coverage**.
- Younger individuals are **less likely** to have checkups or screening.

##  Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks
